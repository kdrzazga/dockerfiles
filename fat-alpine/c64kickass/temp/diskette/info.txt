c1541 -attach disk.d64 8 -read program program.prg

It would save the c64 "program" to the hard drive named program.prg

You could then write the files to another d64 image using

c1541 -attach disk2.d64 8 -write program.prg program

example:

E:\GTK3VICE-3.7-win64\bin\c1541.exe -attach hirespics2.d64 8 -write jez.prg jez

There is also a program called C64Copy and I think it may do what you want as well. I have not played with it much, but I think you can copy certain files from 1 disk image to another

This works differently depending on what target platform you are running VICE on. In Windows, you press Alt+M. In Linux, the keyboard shortcut is instead, for some elusive reason unbeknownst to any but the VICE developers, Alt+H.
