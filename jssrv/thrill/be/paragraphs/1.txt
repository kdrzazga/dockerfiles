The entrance to the Underground is wide, grown with grass and dense bushes. You are checking your clothes and equipment. Light your torch ! You are entering a corridor. The ceiling is high, you don't need to bend. It leads north. Soon you are approaching a T- shaped crossroads. Roads lead to the west, east and south (the direction you've arrived from).
