Welcome Daredevil !!!

They say your veins are filled with freezing water instead of blood, and your muscules are made of the finest steel. Aren't they?

Look towards the setting sun! Over there, on the edge of Almanhagor kingdom, is an entrance to the non-discovered Underworld. Only you can find and reveal its Great Mystery.

Go!
